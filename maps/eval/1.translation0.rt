#Place two spheres at the coordinates {0, 0, 0}, the camera facing those spheres.
#Then put a translation on one of the two spheres oriented in a direction parallel
#to the camera's, of a greater distance than the sphere's
#diameter and display the rendered image. Both spheres should
#be visible and displayed without glitching.
